# WRITING A WYGWYL WORLD

One poem, one world module, one file: `wygwyl/worlds/<NN>-<slug>.mjs`.
Read `wygwyl/worlds/01-out-of-life.mjs` and `02-flashing-lights.mjs` first — they
are the house style, and the style is the point.

---

## THE LAWS (these are not suggestions)

**1. The dot law.** You draw into a 192×144 field of *ink levels*, 0 (paper) to 7
(full ink). Level 8 is the world's single accent colour, used for at most one
thing per film. One halftone pass runs over the whole field at the end, so a face
and a wall are quantised by the same lattice. **No gradients, no blur, no alpha.**
A "fade" is therefore never a cross-fade — it is a per-dot allegiance swap on the
Bayer schedule (`F.bayer(x,y) < amount`), which reads as one substance
*replacing* another rather than two briefly coexisting.

**2. Pure time.** `draw(u, F)` is a pure function of normalised `u ∈ [0,1)`. No
`Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no state kept between frames, no reading the
previous frame. Frame *n* must render identically whether or not frame *n−1* ever
existed. For randomness use `F.noise(x,y)`, `F.n2`, `F.fbm`, or `F.rng(k)` — all
seeded and deterministic. **This is enforced by review; a module that keeps state
will be rejected.**

**3. Break every full-width horizontal span.** An unbroken edge-to-edge bar
stripes the frame under the halftone. Draw a floor as two or three runs with gaps.
The only permitted exception is a surface whose *whole meaning* is that it has no
gap in it — and if you take that exception, say so in a comment.

**4. Nothing is decoration.** Every movement is one line of the poem and every
element on screen is in that line. If the line does not say it, do not draw it.
Conversely: find the image the line actually contains and build the mechanism for
it, do not illustrate the mood. "The gap between us breathes, and never closes" is
a number that oscillates and never reaches zero — that is the scene.

**5. Look at the picture.** Your work is not done when the file parses. Run the
shooter, open the PNGs, and *look*. Every serious defect produces a plausible
picture.

## THE FIELD KIT — `F`

```
F.W, F.H              192, 144
F.clear(l)            fill the field
F.put(x,y,l)          set (overwrite)
F.ink(x,y,l)          set only if darker than what's there  ← the usual one
F.rect(x,y,w,h,l)     filled
F.box(x,y,w,h,l,th)   outline
F.line(x0,y0,x1,y1,l,th)
F.disc(cx,cy,r,l)
F.ring(cx,cy,r,l,th)
F.arc(cx,cy,r,a0,a1,l,th)
F.word(text,cx,cy,pixelHeight,l,set)   rasterised mono, cached. ph ≥ 6 to be legible.
F.wordW(text,ph)                        measure it first if you need to lay out
F.fig(x,y,h,pose,l)   A BODY. x,y is the FEET. h is total height. See figure.mjs.
                      Volumetric: tapered limbs, a real torso, contour plus fill,
                      and parts emitted back-to-front so a body occludes itself.
                      Keep |rot| under ~1.6 rad or it stops reading as a person.
F.noise(x,y)          deterministic 0..1
F.n2(x,y)             smooth value noise
F.fbm(x,y,octaves)    0..1
F.rng(k)              seeded generator, call it for a stream
F.bayer(x,y)          0..1 — the ordered schedule. USE THIS FOR EVERY DISSOLVE.
F.map((x,y,v) => newValue | undefined)   rewrite the whole field
```

Helpers imported from `../halfworld.mjs`:
`TAU, lerp, clamp01, smooth, ss(a,b,x), win(u,a,b,c,d)`
— `ss` is a smoothstep between two edges, `win` is a rise-and-fall window.

## THE POSE — WHAT A BODY CAN DO

```
mode      'stand' | 'walk' | 'sit' | 'fall'
phase     the gait/breath clock. NEVER an integer multiple of u — see below.
face      1 | -1        which way the body is turned
turn      0..1          HOW FAR ROUND. 0 is square to the viewer, 1 is full
                        profile. A walk sets 0.88 and a sit 0.55 on its own;
                        you rarely need to pass this. What it does is
                        foreshorten the trunk and collapse the shoulder and
                        hip JOINTS onto the centre line, which is what lets
                        the legs pass each other instead of straddling.
arms      'down' | 'open' | 'up' | 'reach' | 'hold' | 'swing'
lean      shear, small; a body pushing into or away from something
rot       whole-body rotation about the hip, in radians. |rot| < ~1.6.
```

and the performance controls, which are what separate a body from a diagram:

```
weight    0..1   WHICH LEG THE BODY IS STANDING ON. 0.5 is even and dead;
                 0.15 or 0.85 is contrapposto — the free hip drops, the
                 shoulders counter-tilt. One number, and most of the
                 difference between a person standing and a drawing of one.
breath    0..1   scales the idle rise and fall. Under 1% of frame, deniable,
                 and it is what keeps a held figure alive. Default 1.
                 Set 0 for a body that is not breathing — the dead, a statue,
                 a ghost — and that reads, because everything else breathes.
crouch    0..1   sinks hips and shoulders. Grief, cold, bracing, listening.
headTurn  -1..1  the head leads the body. A figure that looks before it walks
                 reads as intending; one that does not reads as dragged.
headTilt  -1..1  the jaw swings with it. Tilt down is shame or reading;
                 tilt up is looking at a moon.
gesture   [x,y]  put the near hand HERE, in body-local coordinates (origin at
                 the feet, +y up). The elbow solves itself. Use this to make
                 a hand touch a thing that exists in the scene rather than
                 miming near it.
```

**Phase must not be an integer multiple of `u`.** The gait sends both feet to
the same offset twice per stride; if your rate is `u*6` the QA sample at u=0.5
lands exactly there and the body collapses into one vertical stroke. Two films
hit this independently. Use `u*6.35`, not `u*6`.

**One stride per `phase` of 1.** `phase: u * 6.35` is a bit over six strides
across the movement. A body crossing 200 cells in six strides is taking 33-cell
steps, and a body crossing 40 cells in six strides is mincing. Set the rate
from the distance the figure actually travels: roughly one stride per 0.30 of
its own height. There is a bench for this — `wygwyl/zz-gait.html`, eight phases
of one cycle laid out flat, shot with `node wygwyl/shoot.mjs zz-gait`. A gait
is wrong in ways that are obvious across a row and invisible in a single
frame, which is exactly how the first one survived fourteen films.

**A held figure still needs a clock.** `phase` drives breath as well as gait, so
a standing body given `phase: 0` is holding its breath for the whole movement.
Pass `phase: u * 1.7` even when nobody is walking.

## THE MODULE SHAPE

```js
export default {
  n: "07", slug: "07-dj-turn-me-up", title: "DJ TURN ME UP",
  tagline: "eight words, lower case, what this world is",
  accent: "#5aa7ff",          // keep this; the suite has one accent
  seed: 707,                  // NN*101 or similar, must be unique
  drone: { base: 55, steps: [0, 3, 7, 5], bright: false },
      // base Hz of the bed; steps are semitone offsets, one per movement
      // (index 0 is the title card). Low + minor for grief, higher + bright
      // for the ones that lift.
  movements: [ /* ONE PER VOICEOVER LINE, in order */ {
    label: "SHORT CAPS LABEL", seconds: 12,      // 12–15
    line: "the poem line, verbatim, exactly as given",
    fx: { /* optional, see below */ },
    cues: [ { at: 0.28, f: 420, decay: 0.1, gain: 0.5,
              partials: [1, 2.7, 5.3], noise: 0.7, nDecay: 0.02, seed: 71 } ],
    draw(u, F) { ... },
  } ],
};
```

A title card is prepended automatically. Do not write one.

### fx — use them because the line asks for them, never as garnish

```
fx.smear  {taps, spread, fall}   extra SAMPLES of your own draw() at u-k*spread,
                                 each k*fall levels lighter. Motion blur without
                                 alpha. Costs a full redraw per tap — max 3.
fx.kaleido 'x' | 'y' | 'quad'    mirror the field. 'x' for a real mirror,
                                 'quad' for a rose window / a kaleidoscope.
fx.invert (u) => 0..1            dot-schedule inversion. A strobe is
                                 `u => Math.sin(u*TAU*9) > .72 ? .85 : 0`.
fx.shake  (u) => amplitude       whole-field offset in cells. Under ~3.
```

### cues — foley, synthesised, no samples

A cue is a struck body: `f` is its pitch, `partials` its material (integer-ish =
metal/bell, inharmonic = wood/glass), `decay` its size, `noise` the contact
transient. Tail must never be longer than the room. 1–3 cues per movement, on
the beat the line actually names. `at` is a `u` value.

## HOUSE STYLE FOR THE COMMENTS

The header comment says what the world's *grammar* is in three or four lines —
the one formal idea that the poem gave you. Inline comments explain the choices a
reader would otherwise assume were arbitrary, and **record what you rejected**:

```js
/* THE CITY STREAKS UPWARD. It is held at levels 2–4 and pushed to the edges,
   because the two bodies are the subject and a body at 7 has to have somewhere
   to be legible. The first pass gave the towers the whole frame at full ink and
   the fall became a smear on wallpaper. */
```

Never write a comment that says what the next line does.

---

## HOW TO CHECK YOUR WORK

```bash
node harness/serve.mjs 8181 &          # probably already running
node wygwyl/build-shells.mjs           # after adding your file
node wygwyl/shoot.mjs 07               # your number only
```

It prints ink coverage per movement and writes `renders/wygwyl/07-mNN.png`.
**Then read those PNGs with the Read tool and look at them.** Coverage under 2%
is an empty frame; over 93% is a solid one; both are usually bugs. But the
numbers only catch the extremes — the middle is your eye's job. Fix and re-shoot
until every frame is a picture you would put in the film.

---

## KEEP THE FRAME UNDER BUDGET

A field is 27,648 cells and the film wants 16.6 ms. Two things blow that:

- **`F.map` with expensive noise inside it.** `F.fbm(x, y, 3)` per cell is twelve
  value-noise lookups times 27,648. Two octaves is usually indistinguishable and
  costs a third less. Prefer `F.n2` over `F.fbm` when you only need softness.
- **`fx.smear` multiplies everything.** Each tap is a *full redraw* of your
  movement. A 6 ms draw with three taps is 24 ms and drops frames. If your draw
  already ends in a per-cell `F.map`, you get at most one tap.

Measure rather than guess: `renderField` is on `window.__hw.runtime`, so in the
page console `performance.now()` around `__hw.runtime.renderField(t)` tells you
the truth for the timestamp you are actually worried about.

**Measure the frame twice.** `F.word` rasterises a glyph run the first time it
sees one and caches it forever after, so the first render of a movement full of
words pays for all of them at once and every render after it pays nothing. A
movement that measured 49 ms cold measured 5.3 ms warm; only the warm number is
the film's frame rate. Sample each movement once to fill the cache, then again
to read the cost.

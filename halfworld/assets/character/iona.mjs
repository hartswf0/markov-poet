/* character.iona — IONA ASH. Very old. The one who brought the film.
   CHARACTER asset for I REMEMBER BEING A BUTTERFLY (B01). 8 units, and she is
   in the photograph in two more.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   EVIDENCE.

   THE COAT AND THE FACE. BF-17, her entrance, is the only physical description
   of anyone in the whole corpus:
     "A small woman in a navy coat with a flattened fur collar, holding a
      grocery bag darkened at the bottom. Lavender protrudes from it in a thick
      bundle. She looks not up the stairs but at their reflection in the glass
      door. Her face has an unfinished quality — expressions arriving before
      the features can contain them."
     prose  white hair cut bluntly below the ears; under the coat a grey dress
            with a narrow white collar "belonging to another period or to no
            period at all"; the skin deeply lined, "but the expressions moving
            beneath it quick, almost juvenile, arriving before the features
            could contain them."

   THE LAST SENTENCE IS AN ANIMATION NOTE, NOT A DESCRIPTION, and it is the
   reason this module exists in a world that animates. A still frame cannot
   hold "arriving before the features could contain them" — the arrival and the
   containment are two times. So it is a MOTION: `expression_early` samples her
   expressive channels ahead of her postural ones by a fixed lead, and the head,
   neck and jaw catch up afterwards. In every frame of that cycle the face and
   the expression disagree, which is what an unfinished quality is.

   THE SCAR.
     BF-22  "Iona catches Mara's wrist. Her hand is unexpectedly strong. At the
             base of her thumb is a scar: a broken circle crossed by a crooked
             line."
   It is drawn by assets/_broken-circle.mjs, which draws it from the points
   engine/motion.mjs' brokenCircle() returns — the same call that draws the
   wing marking, the flight trace, the pen mark and the new paint. Not a
   similar shape. The same array.

   HER AGE. The text never gives a number. What it gives:
     BF-10  the photograph's reverse: "ASTER HOUSE / AUGUST 1945 / IONA, ELISE,
            THOMAS", and one of the figures is a child.
     BF-26  "Iona is fast for perhaps twenty paces. Then her body remembers its
            age."
   A child in August 1945, alive in a contemporary story, is somewhere near
   ninety. spec.age = 88 is INFERRED, not stated, and it is the only inferred
   number in this file; it drives elderProportion()'s kyphosis, narrowed
   shoulders and raised head-share, which is the whole of what the rig can say
   about an old body. If the setting date is ever fixed, change this one number.

   WHAT SHE SAYS is not drawable and is not drawn: BF-22's three sentences about
   watching the film, BF-27's "Marking is not memory", BF-29's "I remembered it."
   She is never given a knowing look. Her face does the arriving-early thing and
   nothing else, because that is the only expressive fact in the text.

   SILENT. Her build below the coat, her shoes, her hands apart from the scar,
   and her hair's texture. Blunt-cut and white are given; the rest is the
   wardrobe module's shortest mass.

   OVERPAINT, declared: the flattened fur collar, the narrow white collar under
   it, the grocery bag with the lavender, and the scar. The scar and the collar
   are silhouette-relevant and cannot come out of the rig; the bag is an object.

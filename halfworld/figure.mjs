   figure.mjs — THE BODY.

   The first pass of this suite drew people as stick figures: single-cell lines
   from a hip to a shoulder to a head-disc. They read as people, which is why
   it survived fourteen films, but they cannot ACT. A line has no mass, so it
   cannot take weight on one leg; it has no width, so it cannot turn; it has no
   volume, so nothing can be occluded by it and a body can never be in front of
   its own arm.

   This is the replacement. It keeps the same call — fig(x, y, h, pose, level)
   with x,y at the FEET — so every film in the suite gets it at once, and every
   pose name that already existed still means what it meant.

   THREE IDEAS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS.

   1. VOLUME, NOT LINE. Every limb is a tapered capsule: a run of discs whose
      radius interpolates from proximal to distal, so a thigh is thicker than a
      shin and an upper arm is thicker than a wrist. The torso is a real
      quadrilateral from shoulders to hips.

   2. CONTOUR PLUS FILL, IN THAT ORDER, WITH THE LAW INTACT. Each part is laid
      down twice: the whole shape at the contour level with `ink` (which only
      darkens, so it never erases the world behind it), then the shape inset by
      a cell or so at the fill level with `put` (which overwrites, but only
      inside ground the contour pass just claimed). The result is a hard black
      edge around a flat mid tone — the dot law's own idiom, and no gradient
      anywhere.

   3. DRAWING ORDER IS OCCLUSION. Because the fill pass overwrites, a part drawn
      later hides one drawn earlier. So the parts are emitted back to front —
      far arm, far leg, torso, near leg, near arm, head — and a body is suddenly
      in front of itself. This is what makes a reach read as a reach rather than
      as a line crossing a line, and it costs nothing but the order of six
      calls.

   PROPORTION is the standard figure-drawing progression, 7.6 heads for an
   adult, with the landmarks as fractions of total height measured from the
   ground. Nothing here is invented; it is the same table the butterfly
   halfworld's hero rig uses, restated for a lattice instead of a canvas.

   SMALL BODIES DEGRADE ON PURPOSE. Below about fourteen cells a contour and a
   fill are the same cell and the rig turns to mud, so under that height it
   draws a compact solid silhouette instead. Several films stage crowds at
   h=8..13 and they must not become noise.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- THE GUISE
   HOW A DRAWN BODY CAN BE UNMISTAKABLY ONE MAN AND ALSO ANYBODY.

   This world has no faces. At the sizes it draws at, a face is four cells and
   any attempt at one produces a doll. So a likeness cannot be carried by
   features — which turns out to be the useful constraint, because it forces
   the likeness into the SILHOUETTE, and a silhouette is exactly the register
   where both halves of that sentence can be true at once.

   Five marks, all of them outline, none of them a feature:

     hair      the mass on the back and top of the skull, and where its edge
               falls. This is the single strongest identity signal at any
               distance — you know people by their heads from across a street.
     beard     jaw mass. Squares and lengthens the lower head.
     shoulderSlope   square shoulders or fallen ones. Posture, not anatomy.
     stoop     the habitual forward carry of the chest.
     neck      thickness, which reads as build.

   Set them from a real person and the drawn body is recognisably that person
   in every scene, including the dark ones where nothing but the outline
   survives — which is the case this was built for. Describe the same figure in
   words and you have said "a man with short hair and a beard, shoulders a
   little rounded", which is nobody in particular. That is the whole idea: the
   recognition is real and the description is universal.

   POET is measured off the lead clip for OUT OF LIFE — the standing silhouette
   against the hazed window, which is the frame where his outline is clearest. */

       THE BODY WAS FRONTAL AND THE GAIT WAS NOT. Shoulders and hips spread
       along screen x — which, for a figure seen from the side, is the axis the
       legs swing along. So the legs never scissored fore and aft past each
       other; they straddled left and right of a wide frontal pelvis. A walking
       body TURNS, and the turn is handled below by foreshortening the spans.

       THE SWING FOOT WENT INTO THE GROUND. The lift was written as a negative
       height and in this body space positive is up, so every step drove the
       foot below the line the figure stands on.

       THE BODY BOBBED THE WRONG WAY. The hip dropped at mid-stance, when the
       stance leg is vertical and the hip is at its HIGHEST; it should drop at
       double support, when both legs are splayed and the same fixed leg cannot
       reach as far up. Inverted bob is most of what makes a cycle read as a
       waddle.

       THE KNEES DID NOT KNOW WHAT PHASE THEY WERE IN. One fixed backward bend
       on both legs at all times — the stance leg bent while carrying weight,
       and the swing leg stayed straight, when a swing knee folding as it
       passes under the body is the single thing that says "walking" rather
       than "compass".

       The parameterisation: each leg has its own phase q. Foot travel is
       stride·sin q in the sagittal axis. cos q > 0 is the half of the cycle

/* ------------------------------------------------------------ small bodies
   Under about sixteen cells the proportional rig stops describing a person.
   The arithmetic is still right, but every part rounds to one or two cells and
   the result is a vertical smear with specks — worse than the stick figure it
   replaced, which at least had separated limbs.

   So a small body is not a shrunken large one. It is a DIFFERENT DRAWING with
   the same silhouette: a head that is deliberately too big (which is how
   distant figures read in any graphic tradition), one chunky trunk, and legs
   and arms wide enough to survive the lattice. It answers the same poses,
   because a crowd still has to walk and raise its arms. */

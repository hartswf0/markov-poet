   build-film-close.mjs — THE SPEAKING CUT.

   The same film, on the same clock, with one change: whenever someone who is
   in the room says something, the picture goes to their face.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE CONSTRAINT THAT MAKES THIS SAFE.

       THE SOUND IS NOT REBUILT. NOT ONE SAMPLE MOVES.

   audio/master.wav is reused exactly as the wide cut mixed it, and every scene
   keeps the duration film/cut.json gave it. Only the PICTURE inside each scene
   changes. That means drift cannot be introduced by this file — it is not
   arithmetic that happens to come out even, it is a quantity this program has
   no way to alter. The last builder that rebuilt both clocks in parallel put
   the picture 74 seconds away from the sound, and the fix then was the same
   idea as the rule here: one clock, computed once, obeyed by everything.

   So a scene of length D is no longer one looping shot of length D. It is a
   TIMELINE of length D:

       0 ─── wide loop ─── close-up ─ close-up ─── wide loop ─── D
                          ^ Niko      ^ Mara

   and the close-ups sit at the absolute times their voices already occupy in
   the master. Those times are recoverable exactly, because the mixer laid the
   takes by a rule this file re-runs rather than guesses:

       take k starts at  Σ(durations of takes before it) + k · TAKE_GAP

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT STAYS WIDE, AND WHY IT IS NOT LAZINESS.

     · every scene with no dialogue at all — most of the film's images
     · the framing cards
     · voice-over and off-screen lines. A close-up asserts that a body is in
       the room making this sound. For VO, (V.O.) and (O.S.) that assertion is
       false, and in a film whose subject is testimony from a witness that
       cannot be corroborated, putting a face on an unverifiable voice is the
       one lie the film cannot afford. Iona's twenty-nine second voice-over in
       BF-13 is the longest single speech in the picture and it never shows her.

/* ---- ONE FRAME GRID -----------------------------------------------------
   The first build came out 0.912s longer in picture than in sound, and the
   arithmetic is not subtle: 139 segments, each handed to ffmpeg as a duration
   in seconds and each rounding UP to the next whole frame. A twelfth of a
   second, 139 times, mostly in the same direction.

   The consequence is worse than a long file. The error ACCUMULATES, so a cut
   near the end lands most of a second after the voice it belongs to — which is
   precisely the failure this entire cut exists to remove, arriving through the
   back door at assembly time after the lip-sync itself was made exact.

   So durations are not computed per segment at all. Every boundary is snapped
   ONCE to the global frame grid and each segment is given the INTEGER NUMBER
   OF FRAMES between its own two snapped boundaries. Consecutive segments then
   share a boundary by construction, the count telescopes to
   round(total × fps) exactly, and no per-segment rounding survives to be
   added up. Same lesson as the sound clock: one clock, computed once. */

   direct.mjs — WHICH SHOTS EARN A FACE.

   THE ERROR THIS FILE EXISTS TO CORRECT.

   The first speaking cut gave a close-up to every one of the ninety speaker
   runs, because that was a rule and rules are easy to apply to ninety things.
   The result was that 45% of the picture became a talking head, and the film
   cut away from its own best images to get there — away from a green line
   gathering over itself, away from a wall of dated husks emptying left to
   right, away from 1945 being replaced dot by dot by thirty minutes ago.

   Those images are the reason the film exists. The dialogue is spare and mostly
   belongs OVER them. Covering a conversation from both sides on every line is
   not direction; it is television coverage, and it is what you do when you have
   not decided what the scene is about.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE LAW, and it is the film's own motion vocabulary read back at it.

       A CLOSE-UP MAY ONLY INTERRUPT A MOTION THAT COMES ROUND AGAIN.

   CYCLE repeats and HOLD persists. You can leave one of those and come back,
   and the shot will still be there, doing what it was doing.

   TRACE, SWEEP, DISSOLVE, ADVANCE, TRANSFER and BREAK happen ONCE and
   ACCUMULATE. Their whole content is the difference between the beginning and
   the end. Cutting away from a TRACE means the line gathers while nobody is
   watching; cutting away from a SWEEP means the wavefront crosses off-screen;
   cutting away from a DISSOLVE means the substitution — the film's central
   idea, and the thing the dot law was bent to allow — happens in a shot the
   audience is not in.

   MOTION-BRIEF already said this about stills: "Rendering the mark as a
   picture… if it is legible in one frame, you have drawn the wrong thing."
   The same sentence governs the cut. If a shot's content is legible in one
   frame, you may cut away from it. Six of the eight motions exist precisely
   because their content is not.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   AND THEN: THE TURNS.

   The law says where a close-up is PERMITTED. It does not say where one is
   DESERVED. That is not a rule and cannot be — it is a reading of the script,
   and every entry in TURNS below carries the line it is for and the argument
   for putting a face on it. Fifteen moments in forty scenes.

   Two of them are REACTIONS: the camera is on the person receiving the line,
   not the person saying it. Those are the shots this film most needed and had
   none of. "I remembered it" is not interesting on the face of the woman who
   knows it is true. It is interesting on the face of the man who has just been
   told that a building was assembled out of somebody's memory.

/* ---- INSERTS ------------------------------------------------------------
   BF-13 is thirty-three seconds long — the longest unit in the film by eleven
   seconds — and it is one static shot of a handset hanging off a hook. It is
   thirty-three seconds long because Iona's voice-over runs 29.1s and the
   film's clock gives a scene the greater of its dialogue and a whole number of
   its own loops. Nobody chose to hold that image for half a minute; the
   arithmetic chose it, and then it was never looked at again.

   measure-frames.mjs scores it 17.4 "empty seconds" — more than three times
   the next worst shot in the film — and no amount of pushing in fixes it,
   because the defect is not the framing. Holding ONE image under a long
   voice-over is the thing an edit exists to prevent.

   So the voice stays exactly where it is and the picture cuts. Three images the
   film has already established, chosen because the voice is talking about them:

     "You always open it too early. Your mother did. Her mother did."
        -> the photograph, which is the mother and the grandmother
     "The insects wake before the story is ready for them."
        -> the vial, with something testing its circumference
     "I found the boy. He has been dead for eleven years."
        -> back to the phone, because that is who is on it

   No new material. A cut, which is free, against a shot that was costing
   seventeen seconds. */

/* ---- INTRODUCTIONS ------------------------------------------------------
   THE NOTE THIS ANSWERS: "it's too hard to follow — we don't know who is
   speaking."

   Placing the voices in the stereo field was necessary and not sufficient. A
   fixed seat tells you that the person on the left is the same person as last
   time; it cannot tell you WHO that is, because the film never introduced them.
   Mara, Niko and Iona speak for three minutes and the audience is asked to
   assemble three people out of nothing but alternation.

   Film has had the answer to this for a century, and I did not use it: THE
   FIRST TIME SOMEBODY SPEAKS, YOU SEE THEIR FACE. Once. After that the voice
   carries them, because the voice now has a face attached to it and a seat in
   the room.

   And because this film is abstract enough that a face alone may not stick,
   the introduction carries a NAME — mono, bottom left, held for the whole shot.
   Three captions in a seven-minute film. The film already has a card grammar
   and this is the same grammar doing the most basic job there is.

   These are found, not authored: the earliest run by each in-room speaker that
   is long enough to be a shot and sits in a motion that may be interrupted. If
   the first line is too short or lands inside a DISSOLVE, the introduction
   moves to the next one that works, and the report says which. */

/* ---- selection ----------------------------------------------------------
   Three passes, in this order, because the order is the argument.

   1. MATCH every authored turn to the run that carries its line. A turn that
      matches nothing is a typo in the script above, not a directorial choice,
      and must be reported as such rather than silently vanishing.
   2. THE LAW. A scene whose motion accumulates keeps its picture, even if I
      wanted a face there. This runs BEFORE the budget so that "the law forbade
      it" and "there was no room for it" are never confused.
   3. THE BUDGET, in AUTHORING ORDER — the order the turns are written above is
      the order I would defend them in. When a scene runs out of room the last
      turn listed is the one that goes, so the ranking is visible in the source

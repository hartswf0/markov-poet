   treatments.mjs — footage entering the dot law, past what ingest.mjs does.

   ingest.mjs answers one question well: "what ink level does THIS CELL get,
   read through this channel, this tone curve, this dither." Every treatment
   here asks a DIFFERENT question of the same source pixels — not "what level
   is this dot" but "what REGION is this part of," "is this cell part of the
   room's architecture or its haze," "is this the poet's own silhouette,"
   "did this cell change since the last sample," "where does the drawn room's
   window actually line up with the filmed one." None of that is a channel or
   a tone curve; it needs its own small amount of image processing (blur,
   Sobel, connected components, image moments, a guided Hough vote), done
   here, once, and then handed back as the same shape every other module in
   this suite already agrees on: a flat Float32Array, FW*FH long, values
   0..8, no alpha, nothing between frames.

   THE LAW, restated for this file specifically. Everything below produces a
   FLAT, QUANTISED field — 8 ink levels, no gradients, no blur baked into the
   output, no alpha — even where the technique (a blurred Sobel pass, an
   averaged "long exposure," a vignette) sounds continuous. Where a treatment
   needs to represent something that would naturally be a gradient (a
   falloff, a mean of several frames), it goes through the SAME move
   ingest.mjs and halfworld.mjs both use: compute a continuous 0..1 amount,
   then resolve it to a flat level through the ordered (Bayer) schedule. A
   gradient never gets stored; a dot pattern that READS as one does.

   TWO SHAPES OF FUNCTION, both pure.
     · FIELD treatments — swap/wipe/byLevel's own shape (blend.mjs): pure
       functions of one or more already-sampled Float32Arrays, returning a
       new one. motionInk, heldMemory, crushReverse, grainReverse,
       vignetteReverse, windowPortal/paintedWindow/windowLock, byStructure,
       longExposure, tracedFigure, paperFigure.
     · SOURCE treatments — pure functions of an ImageData-shaped `img`
       ({data,width,height}, exactly what canvas.getContext('2d')
       .getImageData(...) returns) PLUS opts. contourFill, structureLines,
       figureSilhouette, kaleidoField, resonantKaleido. Every one of these
       assumes img is already FW×FH — the same size ingest.mjs's own
       offscreen canvas samples down to (`makeIngest(el).canvas`), so the
       usual way to get one is to call ingest.sample() for its side effect
       on `.canvas`, then read that canvas's pixels here. No treatment in
       this file draws a video frame itself — that stays ingest.mjs's job,
       so there is exactly one place a video or a still-image element is
       ever read from, which is also why every fallback ingest.mjs already
       has (naturalWidth/naturalHeight when there's no videoWidth) keeps
       working for every treatment here with no extra code.

   fieldKit(buf) — a second, tiny reimplementation of exactly three of
   halfworld.mjs's makeKit primitives (put/ink/disc, plus a line() built the
   same way makeKit's own is). Not imported, because makeKit is not exported
   (blend.mjs hits the same wall and carries its own Bayer matrix for the
   same reason — see its header). This is bound to a plain Float32Array
   instead of a live runtime buffer, which is what lets tracedFigure call
   figure.mjs's real drawFigure() — the SAME rig every world in the suite
   draws with — and structureLines call a real line-stamper, while every
   export in this file keeps blend.mjs's convention: take fields, return a
   field, never a kit tied to something stateful.

   Read EXPERIMENTS.md and BLEND-NOTES.md before tuning any default below —
   both found real, non-obvious things about THIS footage (the levels/tone
   order bug, the blue-channel bug) that every treatment here inherits by
   sharing readChannel()'s weights with ingest.mjs's own channelValue().

   1 · CONTOUR FILL — the full tonal halfworld: contour plus flat interior
   fill, figure.mjs's OWN technique (contour pass with `ink`, inset fill pass
   with `put`) turned into a whole-frame treatment instead of a body's.

   ingest.mjs's quantize() asks, independently per cell, "which of 8 levels
   does THIS DOT land on" — correct, and it's what makes a wall under
   changing light come out as a fine, photographically-plausible dither
   texture. That is also exactly the tell: a photograph that has been
   halftoned still reads as a halftoned photograph. This asks a different
   question — "which flat REGION is this cell part of" — assigns the whole
   region one level with NO per-cell dither, and inks a hard line only where
   two regions actually meet. That is the difference between a printer's
   output and an illustrator's, and it is entirely a difference in what
   counts as the unit of quantisation (the cell vs. the region), not in the
   dot law itself: both are flat, 8-level, alpha-free. `blur` sets how big a
   mark has to be to count as its own region — under it, the graffiti wall's
   own texture disappears into whatever band its neighbourhood belongs to,
   which is the point (a photograph's texture is not the room's geometry).

   2 · STRUCTURE LINES — Hough-ish, guided by gradient orientation. Finds the
   room's own straight edges (the window frame, the wall/ceiling line, the
   fire escape's rails) and REDRAWS them as clean strokes on otherwise blank
   paper, discarding every pixel that isn't part of one. The footage becomes
   a source of GEOMETRY, not of tone — the strongest possible answer to
   "prove this wasn't filmed," because a Hough line has no photographic
   texture left in it to prove it ever was.

   GUIDED, not exhaustive. A textbook Hough transform votes every edge pixel
   into every theta bin and lets the accumulator sort it out — correct, and
   wasteful: a pixel sitting on a vertical edge has no business voting for a
   line at 40°. Each edge pixel here only votes within `thetaSpread` bins of
   the angle its OWN Sobel gradient implies (a line runs perpendicular to
   the gradient at every point on it) — faster, and it keeps a dense patch of
   graffiti's own incoherent gradients from drowning out the room's few long,
   consistent edges with sheer numbers, which an unguided vote count cannot
   tell from a real line.

   `minVoteRatio` is the second half of that same fight: even guided, this
   footage's own texture keeps a long tail of weak, spurious peaks behind
   the real edges rather than going quiet. Stopping once a candidate's vote
   falls under `minVoteRatio` of the STRONGEST one found is what turns
   "twelve lines, half of them noise" into "the four or five the room
   actually has" — down for more lines (closer to a scribble), up for fewer
   (closer to a floor plan).

   8 · REGISTRATION — placing the same window in the same place.

   01-out-of-life.mjs draws its window at a FIXED screen position
   (`windowAt`, called with wx≈150–176 across the film — see
   worlds/01-out-of-life.mjs, which this suite does not edit) and the
   footage's own window cannot be made to land exactly there by panning and
   zooming — it would need a crop WIDER than the source frame actually is.
   Worked through in full in NOTES.md; the short version: the window occupies
   about 30% of the SOURCE frame's own width, and reaching the drawn box's
   position (82–96% across a 192-cell field) would need a crop wide enough
   to still contain the window while shrinking it to 14% of that crop's
   width — more horizontal source than 1280px holds. So this is REGION
   registration, not pixel registration: the calibration below gets the
   footage's window into the same THIRD of the frame the drawn one lives in
   (right of centre), which is as far as a simple crop can honestly reach —
   and `windowPortal`/`paintedWindow`/`windowLock` all take a `rect`
   argument rather than assuming one, so a recipe can use whichever box

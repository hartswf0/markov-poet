   shoot.mjs — LOOK AT THE PICTURE.

   Law 5 of the butterfly halfworld: every serious defect produced a plausible
   picture, and every one was caught by looking at an image rather than by a
   test. So this renders each world at real timestamps and writes PNGs, and it
   also reports the INK COVERAGE of each frame — a frame that is 0% or 96% ink
   is a bug the eye can miss in a contact sheet but a number cannot.

     node wygwyl/shoot.mjs                 every world, one frame per movement
     node wygwyl/shoot.mjs 01 07           only these
     node wygwyl/shoot.mjs --sweep 04      three frames per movement (u=.2/.5/.8)
     node wygwyl/shoot.mjs --motion        no pictures: does each movement MOVE?

   --sweep is the one that finds real defects. A movement that is a picture at
   its midpoint can still be empty paper for its first three seconds, and a
   single sample per movement will never say so.

   Stretching every film to its own passage of the record made each movement

   whether that extra time has anything in it — a figure walking clean across
   the frame barely changes either number, and a still picture held for
   twenty-eight seconds does not change them at all. So this samples the field
   itself at nine points and counts the cells that differ: `step` is the mean
   change between consecutive samples, `span` is how much of the field is
   different at the end of the movement from the start. A movement with a low
   step and a low span is a photograph, and the retime just made it a longer

/* ============================================================================
   00 · WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU LEAVE — TITLE C: THE CATALOGUE — a WYGWYL halfworld

   A GRID OF CELLS, each one an independent Lissajous figure x=sin(p·t+φ),
   y=sin(q·t+ψ). p is a fixed integer per cell — the cell's identity. q is
   NOT fixed: q(u) = q0 + drift·u, a constant added every step, so the
   figure a cell draws keeps changing shape (Whitney's incremental drift).
   When q(u) passes an integer the ratio p:q simplifies and the squiggle
   collapses to a single closed loop — the resonance — and because q0 is
   chosen so that crossing happens at an EXACT, chosen u, the loop always
   lands on time without the frame ever searching for it.

   THE TITLE ASSEMBLES ONE CELL AT A TIME: the grid is laid out one column
   per character of the line being spelled, q0 for each occupied column is
   solved backward from a left-to-right lock schedule, and the instant a
   column locks its loop is swapped for that column's own slice of the
   word's raster and stays there — a contact sheet turning, column by
   column, into type. Columns that are spaces never lock; they are left
   dancing, which is the closest this device gets to punctuation.

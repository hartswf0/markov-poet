   00 · WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU LEAVE — THE AURA
   the fused title: the arabesque and the catalogue, with the poems inside them

   Option B ran nested rings counter-rotating at integer ratios. Option C ran a
   grid of Lissajous cells that locked, one at a time, into letters. Both are
   Whitney's one idea — a field of elements on differential phase, passing
   through order and back — seen from two distances: B from far enough away
   that the whole field is one breathing figure, C from close enough that each
   cell is its own clock.

   This is both distances at once, and a third thing that neither had.

   THE FUSION. The rings are the ground and they never stop. The cells live ON
   the rings rather than in a grid — each ring carries a ring of cells, and a
   cell's Lissajous frequency pair is derived from the ring it rides, so the
   whole field is still ONE law: ring r turns at r times the base rate, and its
   cells trace (r : r+1) figures. When a ring's cells reach a simple ratio they
   lock, and what they lock into is a letter.

   THE AURA — and this is the part that is not Whitney. A title sequence for
   fourteen poems should be haunted by them. At each ring's resonance the field
   also throws up ONE IMAGE from the films behind it: the tambourine that goes
   through a window in 02 and shatters in 03, the rose window, the moon of 09,
   the temple of 11, the daisy of 07, the hourglass of 12, the ring of 10, the
   candle of 06, the stars of 05. They arrive at low ink, hold for a breath,
   and are taken back by the rotation. Nothing announces them. If you have seen
   the films they are memories; if you have not they are ornament, and both
   readings are correct — which is the same trick the guise plays with a face.

   The tambourine and the rose window are IMPORTED from the films that own them,
   not redrawn. A motif that exists twice is two motifs.

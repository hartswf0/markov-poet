   01 · OUT OF LIFE — a WYGWYL halfworld

   The beflix film's own motifs, restaged: the haze claims the room left to
   right (a per-dot allegiance swap, not a fade); the gap between the falling
   bodies is 24 cells, breathes ±3, and never closes; his words fall beside
   him as tumbling dashes; the last light in the film is the vape ember.

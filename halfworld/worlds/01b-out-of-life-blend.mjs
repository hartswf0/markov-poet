   01b · OUT OF LIFE, BLEND — a WYGWYL halfworld, second version

   Same poem as 01-out-of-life.mjs, same four movements, same four verbatim
   lines — this version is not a rewrite, it is the same film with the actual
   lead footage let into the dot law. THE FIGURE carries GUISES.poet /
   GUISES.turned, measured off this same clip, so the silhouette reads as the
   same man whether the dot under him belongs to the camera or the drawing.

   TIMING IS THE CLIP'S, NOT THE COMPUTED FILM'S. `01-out-of-life-lead.mp4` is
   already cut to its own reading of this poem — the picture in it is timed to
   the voice. So `movements[i].seconds` below is not a round production number
   the way it is in 01-out-of-life.mjs; it is the measured length, in the
   source clip, of the passage that carries that movement's line. The mapping
   (silence-gap analysis + the visual scene order, since no transcript or ASR
   was available in this environment) is recorded in full in BLEND-NOTES.md —
   read that before changing any number here. The four durations replace the
   original 13/13/13/14 with 25.67/25.75/21.30/12.58, which is why this film
   runs to about 90s against the computed version's 58s.

   FOOTAGE — what the shell overlays on top of the computed field above.

   Positionally aligned with `movements` (index 0 = THE SEARCH; no entry for
   the title card, which is always pure drawing — the clip hasn't started
   "playing" yet at that point, see 01b-out-of-life-blend.html).

     clipStart   the source clip's OWN timecode, in seconds, where this
                 movement's u=0 begins. clipStart + movements[i].seconds is
                 therefore always exactly the next movement's clipStart (or
                 the end of the file, for the last one) — the shell's clock
                 for movements 1..4 IS the video's real playback position,
                 not something scrubbed frame by frame, because the clip's
                 own audio is this film's soundtrack now (see BLEND-NOTES.md)
                 and audio wants to play forward, not be sought every frame.
     segments    sub-ranges of that movement's own u ∈ [0,1) — a movement may
                 change footage register, blend mode, or both partway through
                 (most of them do; the source clip itself cuts scenes inside
                 a single spoken line). Each segment:
       u0, u1      the slice of u this segment owns
       opts        passed straight to ingest.mjs's sample()
       blend       swap | wipe | byLevel | noiseSwap | figureLock, OR
                   "figureLockTorn" — a composite defined in the shell (not
                   in blend.mjs, which is not edited): noiseSwap's torn
                   schedule for the environment, with the drawn figure(s)
                   still locked in per figureLock's own rule. Used where the
                   brief asks for BOTH a torn dissolve AND a protected body.
       blendOpts   the extra positional args that blend fn takes
       mix(p)      p is local progress through the segment, 0..1 — returns
                   the blend's own t (absolute, 0..1, not relative to the
                   segment before it — see BLEND-NOTES.md for why each curve

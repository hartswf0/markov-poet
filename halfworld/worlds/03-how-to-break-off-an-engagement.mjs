   03 · HOW TO BREAK OFF AN ENGAGEMENT — a WYGWYL halfworld

   The tambourine that went through a window in 02 arrives here through a rose
   window, still whole, and leaves in pieces. Between those two facts: an empty
   temple, a storm that takes everything that was ever called goods, and two
   sets of footprints walking away from what the water kept.

   THREE OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN OVER TIME AND WERE DRAWN AS THINGS
   THAT WERE ALREADY OVER. A cobweb is BUILT — bridge, frame, radials, then the
   spiral wound outward turn by turn — and drawing the finished doily is
   drawing the wrong noun. Footsteps are made one at a time and there are more
   of them at the end. A tambourine that shatters stops being one object; the
   pieces travel, land, and stay landed. So each of those three is now a
   quantity that only goes one way, and the frame is built out of tone under
   it: dust, mud, water, sand.

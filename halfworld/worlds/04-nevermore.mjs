   04 · NEVERMORE — a WYGWYL halfworld

   ONE TRAIL, FOLLOWED TWICE, and each time it ends in a body part taken back
   and sworn over in the same breath: the heart out of the debris, the hands
   off the bare ground. So the film is built as two identical arcs in inverted
   material — the first half is ink arriving on paper, the second is paper
   carved out of ink, and the vow is the same word both times, arriving on the
   Bayer schedule in whichever substance that half is made of.

   The descent is monotone and one-way: dusk shore (paper sky) → moonlit field
   (a flat level-2 night) → the deepest dark the suite has. Nothing in this
   world brightens again. "Nevermore" is not the grief here, it is the hinge.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- the sea
   Horizontal wavefronts. calm ∈ 0..1 does TWO things at once, because the
   line asks for both: it kills the amplitude AND collapses the row spacing,
   so the sea does not merely go still, it FOLDS — ten swells stacking into a
   tight sheaf of whispers.

   The rows are spaced in perspective (crowded at the horizon, open at the
   shore) and each row's amplitude is held strictly under half its spacing.
   The first pass gave every row the same spacing and let amplitude grow with
   nearness: neighbouring crests crossed each other and the whole sea came out
   as a diamond fishnet — a plausible picture of nothing.

   Every row is broken twice at its own x. Ten unbroken full-width lines is

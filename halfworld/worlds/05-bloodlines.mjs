   05 · BLOODLINES — a WYGWYL halfworld

   ONE GRAPH, FOUR COSTUMES. Nine ancestors are nine nodes and twelve ties.
   They are the constellation he names, the Southern pine over the basement,
   the vessels feeding a fingerprint, and the book-matched veining in the
   marble of the gates — the same coordinates every time, so the film has a
   skeleton the eye recognises before it can say why.

   NAMING IS THE MECHANISM OF OWNERSHIP. A star is unclaimed until the label
   lands on it, and the label types out letter by letter; the tie between two
   stars is not drawn until both have names. He asks the galaxy for its name
   and the galaxy does not answer, because the line says "if I may".

   AND IT GETS BIGGER. M1 is a small man under a wide empty sky; by M4 the
   fingerprint has outgrown the frame and by M5 the gates run off all four
   edges. One accent mark in the whole film — the light he inherits rather
   than takes — and it sits on the same node of the graph in every costume.
   M3 has none, because M3 is the movement where he owns nothing yet.

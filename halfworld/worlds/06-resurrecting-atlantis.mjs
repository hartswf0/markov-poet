   06 · RESURRECTING ATLANTIS — a WYGWYL halfworld

   THE WATERLINE DESCENDS, ONCE, ACROSS THE WHOLE FILM. One number — waterY —
   starts near the top of the frame in M1 (the city is a rumour: two spire
   tips) and is walked down, movement by movement, until it exits the bottom
   of the frame partway through M4 and never returns. Every building, every
   window, every crowd of people rides that single falling line — the same
   BUILD array and the same clip is reused in five different movements, the
   way BLOODLINES reused one graph in four costumes. The waterline itself is
   drawn as the one unbroken span the dot law allows, because its entire
   meaning IS that it has no gap in it — and in M1 it is also the horizon
   the sky ends at and the vanishing point the road runs to, because the
   yellow brick road is a causeway out over that water.

   "LEAVING BEHIND CROSSHAIRS FOR CONTINUUMS" is built literally in M5: a
   scope reticle (four arms that stop short of the centre) is, cell by cell
   on the Bayer schedule, REPLACED by a ring at the same radius — a shape
   with no ends and no gap — and each ring then widens away off the edges of
   the world, because a continuum that holds still is only a circle. The
   whole movement is seen through the last of those scopes: its aperture is
   the one that opens, until it is wider than the frame and there is no
   instrument left to look through. "Strains for serendipity" is the same
   release read in the body — a man who starts braced and ends open — rather
   than a second image built for the second clause.

   AND THE LAST MOVEMENT DRAWS THE CITY BY NOT DRAWING IT. M6 fills every
   cell the city is NOT — one number, one Bayer schedule, the whole night
   arriving at once — so the city is left standing as reserve, out of the
   blank page it was always on, which is what "born in unison, out of the
   purest of fictions" says. Its second clause is a count: one man walks in
   from the edge and is met at the middle of the plaza, and then ten more,
   until the ground the film spent five movements raising out of the water
   has twelve people standing on it.

   THE ONE UTOPIA IN THE SUITE. Populated on purpose — the plaza in the last
   movement is never one figure, it is a crowd that raises its arms
   together. The single accent (level 8) is one object seen twice: the spark
   a comet carries down in M1, the beacon lit on the tallest dome in M6.
   Rejected: giving every movement its own accent moment — the brief that
   comes with this world calls the accent budget "at most one thing," and a
   soul that only ever appears departing and arriving is that one thing.

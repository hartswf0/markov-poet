   09 · YET, HEARD — a WYGWYL halfworld

   THREE CALLS, ONE GRAMMAR. Each of the first three movements is one line of
   the poem and one drawn LINE: a dashed, pulsing cord strung between two
   standing figures, because a call is a pulsed thing and an unbroken cord
   edge-to-edge is exactly the stripe the dot law warns about. The distance
   between the two figures is the plot — it stretches across each movement,
   years folded into seconds — and each time something different rides the
   cord: a shared moon, then tears that peel off into an abyss, then his
   footsteps, retraced. The fourth movement drops the device entirely: the
   calls are over, the walk is no longer imagined, and it is the one place
   in the film that earns the suite's single blue mark.

   ONLY FOUR MOVEMENTS, so each one is long and mostly stillness — this is
   the quietest film in the suite. Rejected outright: a room for each call
   (a kitchen, a car, a doorway). None of the three lines names a room, only
   a person on the other end, so no room is built; two figures and a cord
   are the whole set.

/* THE CORD. Dashed, never solid — a call is pulses, not a wire — and its
   dash pattern is stepped by `flow` so the connection reads as live rather
   than printed on. `sag` bows the midpoint away from level: positive pulls
   it down, negative lifts it into the sky. It is 0 for the father's call,
   which holds level; negative for the lover's, which rises to a shared
   moon; and only ever positive for the mother's, where what she is
   carrying visibly pulls the cord out of true. */

/* a speaker: the pose is almost nothing, because the cord is the subject
   and a figure at rest does not compete with it. A short tick under each
   pair of feet, not a floor across the frame — a call happens in no
   particular room, so no room is built under it. Still needs a clock — a
   standing figure with no `phase` holds its breath for the whole call —
   and a slow weight drift, because "almost nothing" is not "nothing": two
   people on a long call shift their feet without ever pacing. `extra`

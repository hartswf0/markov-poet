   10 · MAGIC RIDE — a WYGWYL halfworld

   THE RIDER NEVER MOVES. The bike sits fixed at frame centre for the whole
   film and everything else — road, skyline, the rows of people at the
   roadside — streams past it horizontally. That is the one camera this world
   owns, and it is what lets the night-to-morning turn (M4) read as arrival
   rather than filter: the dawn is just another thing streaming past, only
   slower than the road, so it washes over the fixed bike exactly once.

   NIGHT IS REPLACED, NOT FADED. The sky is a flat dark tone; morning is
   paper. M4 does not dim one into the other — a travelling front sweeps
   through screen space and every sky cell it reaches is handed to F.bayer:
   still-night on one side of the dither band, morning on the other, never
   both at once in the same cell. Stars die in the order the front reaches
   them, which is the same mechanism applied to a different substance.

   THE BIKE IS WHEELS AND ANGLES: two rings and a triangulated strut frame,
   never a drawn silhouette — except in M1, which is the film's one close shot
   and its one movement with a hand on the machine. There the frame's open
   triangles fill in with plates as he works his aggressions into them, and the
   bike stands at 1.5 against the 1.05 the ride runs at. It is still fixed at
   frame centre; the camera has only stopped being far away. From the road it
   is a skeleton again, which is all anyone sees of a machine going past.
   A head that turns to watch is a disc nudged off its neck point toward the
   thing it's watching — rotating the whole small body over-rotated at this
   scale and stopped reading as a person.

   ONE ACCENT: a glint off the tank. It is lit by whatever light is out —
   moonlight in M1–M3, its own last spark as dawn reaches the bike in M4,
   morning sun in M5–M6 — the same mark, the same steel, never two different
   things wearing the accent.

   11 · NEW DAY — a WYGWYL halfworld

   ADVANCE. The temple is not revealed, dissolved into, or cross-faded up —
   it is COUNTED into being: nineteen pieces (three platform courses, six
   columns, seven entablature blocks, two pediment slopes, one finial), each
   arriving on its own Bayer schedule and then DWELLING, untouched, while the
   next piece takes its turn. It is drawn from ONE function, `temple(F,
   progress, l)`, called with a bigger `progress` in M3 than in M2 and a
   bigger one still — complete — in M6. Same cx, same ground line, same six
   columns: the discipline of this film is that there is only ever one
   drawing of this building.

   LIGHT IS THE OTHER THING BEING COUNTED, and it only ever goes one way.
   Fog claims the ground in M1 and gives it back; then the night comes off the
   sky from the horizon up (M2), the last of the air is cut away by wedges
   opening from the risen sun (M3), and in M6 the whole of it happens again at
   full strength and on the ground — a terminator running west across the
   valley floor as the sun clears the ridge. Each is a different mechanism for
   the same one-way fact, and all four are per-dot allegiance swaps: this
   world has no dimmer.

   Fog is the first of those fronts: an edge that sweeps across x, in on the
   first half of M1 and out on the second — one triangular number for
   "floating... as it exhales." The infinity pool (M4) never draws its own
   reflection: it draws the sky once, in the top half of the field, and lets
   the engine's own `kaleido:'y'` — the one honest use of that fx in the
   suite — fold it into the bottom half, because a still pool's reflection
   really is an exact mirror and this is the one place in the suite where
   that happens to be true rather than a shortcut. M5 walks on the water by
   making the surface's own amplitude a number that goes to zero under his
   feet and nowhere else — the miracle is arithmetic, not a caption.

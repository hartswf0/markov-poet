   13 · HOW TO WIN MY HEART — a WYGWYL halfworld

   ONE QUANTITY PER MOVEMENT, AND IT ONLY EVER GOES ONE WAY. The tide comes in
   under the small tables; the dark comes down over the counted orbits; the
   smoke goes up off the burning letters; the field goes down in front of the
   harvester; the picture comes into focus on the distant window. Every one of
   those is a number the line itself names, every one is a PICTURE rather than
   an inference, and not one of them turns round.

   The harbor is built as a single tonal pass — sky, mud, water, quay decided
   per cell in one map — so a tide is a moved boundary rather than a redrawn
   object, and so the same place can hold an afternoon, a dusk and a night
   without being drawn three times. That pass is also why this film is made of
   TONE: an earlier version drew the harbor as five broken rows of wavelets on
   bare paper and the frame came out 94% paper — a diagram of a harbor rather
   than a harbor, and a diagram cannot hold a tide.

   same pass as an ordered-dither offset, so the night arrives dot by dot
   (the law's own dissolve) rather than as a level being turned up. The quay

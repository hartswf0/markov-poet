   14 · HOT MINUTE — a WYGWYL halfworld

   THE FINALE. Everything this suite ever built is taken by ONE mechanism,
   used twice: a per-dot allegiance swap that starts at the water and climbs
   — first over the skyline (M1), then over the man himself, from the feet
   up (M2), because "I have been weather before" is not a mood to paint, it
   is a claim that the SAME function already did this to him once, thirty
   seconds earlier, in this very film. Then black with no rectangle in it —
   the one movement in the whole suite that owns no walls, because by then
   nothing built is still standing to have any. Then nine icons, one per
   beat, faster each time — the suite's own motifs and nothing else, each
   drawn by a one-purpose function that stops at the noun. Then two dancers
   who orbit rather than fall (01's falling pair, run with the sign flipped).
   Then a door — the ONE accent this film spends — that he walks to and,
   this time, through: not the window he went out of in 01 by accident, but
   a door he chooses on purpose.

   ONLY dissolve this film uses, in M1 on the skyline and again in M2 on the

/* the reel: eight equal beats (~1.43s, under the 1.5s target) and a ninth

   about a second and only a shape that big lands in it. No cross-fade
